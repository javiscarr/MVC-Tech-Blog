## Description

This app utilizes many different files, database storage, and technologies to create a Tech blog. A user can view any blogs on the main page and click them to see the comments. Both the post and comments will show who posted them.

If a user would like to create their own blog they can sign up to create an account or login to an existing one. Once logged in, the user will then have access to a dashboard for posting blogs. The user can also go to other blogs and comment on them leaving their name and a date.

The user is able to logout in order to end their session.
